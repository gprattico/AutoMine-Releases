# AutoMine

AutoMine is a Java application useful for automatically restarting a crypto miner (specifically lolMiner.exe) on your local Windows PC. This comes in handy if the graphics card of your machine is unstable, which frequently results in unstable hashrates.

## Prequisities:
Windows Vista 32 Bit or newer
Java 8 Installed on your computer or newer
MSI Afterburner overclocking utility installed on your computer

## How to Use
- Set a new environment variable MINE_LOC to the directory which contains lolMiner.exe
- Unzip the [package](https://github.com/gprattico/AutoMine-Releases/releases/tag/v1.0) and double click on `start.bat`
- Set profile 1 in MSI Afterburner to be your default (not overclocked settings)
- Set profile 2 in MSI Afterburner to be your overclocked settings.
